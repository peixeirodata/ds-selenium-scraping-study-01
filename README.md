# ds-selenium-scraping-study-01

This repository was created as a help to a friend and a study about the Selenium Python's library.

## Overview

In this study, I had a _.xlsx_ file with 3 columns: the first one filled with some brand names to be searched at google's website, the second and third ones was empty. The objective was iterate over the brand names executing the search, return the url of the first result for each search and save it as the second column. Then, access all these urls info in "https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo" and extract the number of accesses of each url and save as the third column.

After all, save all the content in a new _.xlsx_ file.
