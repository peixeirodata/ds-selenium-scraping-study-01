# ds-selenium-scraping-study-01

This repository was created as a help to a friend and a study related to Selenium Python's library.

## Overview

In this study, I had an _.xlsx_ file with 3 columns: the first one filled with some brand names, the second and third ones was empty. The objective was iterate over the brand names, access google's website and perform a search with these names. Then, return the urls as the first result in the search and save it as the second column. Then, access all these urls info by "https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo" and extract the number of access of each one and save as the third column.

After all, save all the content in a new _.xlsx_ file.
